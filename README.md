Software scripts for doing magnetic manipulation computations in Python. In order to compute a basic field and visualize it run:
## Installation
In order to use the scripts, create a new virtual envvironment and install the required dependencies in this virtual environment:

    py -3.7 -m venv mag_actuation
    activate ./mag_actuation/Scripts/activate.bat
    python -m pip install -r dependencies.txt
    
Run `python actuation_computation.py` to plot a simple field.
